                  applications, from simple static websites to dynamic
                  applications that power some of the biggest tech firms in the
                  country.

                  During my tenure at FNB Eswatini, my core duties were to mould
                  to perfection the Eswatini MarketSquare Website. A project
                  that seeks to bring all the everyday resources to one square.
                  "Do you need a plumber? Find them on MarketSquare!" and yes, I
                  took over the reigns from a design agency to build this
                  website using WordPress, and a bit of pure PHP and JavaScript
                  to extend it's functionality.

                  This is one of the many projects I worked on while I was at
                  ScopeHost. It's primarily built with Wordpress since it does
                  does not require complex user input processing. Building this
                  website included exercises in photography, and photo editing,
                  graphics manipulation and critical thinking capabilities to
                  best craft the website specific to the organisation's needs.

                  I, together with 3 other brilliant developers collaborated to
                  create this beautiful project that aids in simplifying the
                  process it takes for students leaving senior secondary to
                  apply at tertiary institutions. This project was facilitated
                  by The Knowledge Institute, and the tech stack used was Django
                  (Python Framework) for the backend and React (Javascript
                  Library) for the frontend.

                  The HTML Audio API provides an interface to manipulate audio
                  files with the help of a few JavaScript libraries. For this
                  little app, I was experimenting on a music player and I was
                  able to come up with something that extracts MP3 metadata from
                  ID3 metadata container, a de facto standard for MP3 files.
                  This App can be used as building blocks to creating Apps like
                  Soundcloud and Bandcamp

                  Sometimes I just like to play around a few html native APIs.
                  This little app does basic image processing and can be used as
                  builidng blocks to create advanced image processing tools
                  similar to Instagram Editor and other image editing tools

                  This sortable list app utilises the html drag and drop API to
                  sort through a list of my favourite songs. It's a short script
                  that allows you to sort through the list while the checking if
                  the order is correct. This API can be used as building blocks
                  to create complex projects such as task management and
                  collaboration applications as well as interactive image
                  galleries.
