                                    My name is Kwanele Simelane, and I'm a fullstack developer based in Mbabane, Eswatini. 
                                    I have developed vast types of web applications, from simple static websites 
                                    to dynamic applications that power some of the biggest tech firms in the country.

                                    I am passionate about cutting-edge technology, and beautiful interfaces that

                                    During my tenure at FNB Eswatini, my core duties were to 
                                    mould to perfection the Eswatini MarketSquare Website. A project that seeks to bring all the everyday resources to one square. 
                                    "Do you need a plumber? Find them on MarketSquare!" and yes, I took over the reigns from a design agency to build this website using WordPress, 
                                    and a bit of pure PHP and JavaScript to extend it's functionality.

                                    This is one of the many projects I worked on while I was at ScopeHost. 
                                    It's primarily built with Wordpress since it does does not require complex user input processing. 
                                    Building this website included exercises in photography, and photo editing, 
                                    graphics manipulation and critical thinking capabilities to best craft the website specific to the organisation's needs.

                                    The HTML Audio API provides an interface to manipulate audio files with the help of a few JavaScript libraries.
                                    For this little app, I was experimenting on a music player and I was able to come up with something that extracts MP3 metadata
                                    from ID3 metadata container, a de facto standard for MP3 files. This App can be used as building blocks to creating Apps like 
                                    Soundcloud and Bandcamp

                                    Sometimes I just like to play around a few html native APIs.
                                    This little app does basic image processing and can be used as builidng blocks
                                    to create advanced image processing tools similar to Instagram Editor and other image editing tools

                                    This sortable list app utilises the html drag and drop API to sort through a list 
                                    of my favourite songs. It's a short script that allows you to sort through the list while the checking 
                                    if the order is correct. This API can be used as building blocks to create complex projects such as task management and collaboration applications 
                                    as well as interactive image galleries.
