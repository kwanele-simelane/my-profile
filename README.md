# This is my Profile

I'm Kwanele Simelane, fullstack developer based in Mbabane, Eswatini. 
Currently a frontend developer at Digimage - Salvtec.

I develop primarily in Javascript and PHP. 
Currently pursuing Software Engineering with #ALX-SE and hacking on a new PHP MVC framework. 
I also build minor projects with Laravel on the side.

I built this website with pure html, css and javascript as an experiment to text my skills with these tools.

I am available to collaborate on any open source projects on any language and any software development tool.
